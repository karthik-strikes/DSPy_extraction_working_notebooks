GIGLIO, DDS, MED,\\* AND DANIEL M. LASKIN, DDS, MSt\n\nA single-dose, randomized, double-blind, parallel-treatment study was performed in 200 outpatients with acute pain caused by the surgical removal of impacted third molars. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, meclofenamate 100 mg, codeine 60 mg, and placebo treatment groups were compared for sum of pain intensity differences, peak pain intensity difference, sum of pain relief scores, peak pain relief, number of observations at which pain was half relieved, overall evaluation of effectiveness, and time to remedication with a backup analgesic. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg was significantly more effective (P < .005) than codeine 60 mg for all variables except number of observations at which pain was half relieved. Both meclofenamate-codeine combinations and meclofenamate 100 mg alone were significantly more effective (P < .005) than placebo for all variables. Eleven adverse experiences were reported in 7 patients (3.5%); the most common was somnolence in 1 patient receiving meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, in 2 treated with meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, and in 1 treated with codeine 60 mg.\n\nMeclofenamate sodium (Meclomen, Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research Division, Warner-Lambert Co, Morris Plains, NJ), a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and competes with formed prostaglandins for receptor sites. L-4 It has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Published literature provides evidence that meclofenamate is safe and effective in the treatment of patients with acute dental pain following third molar extraction,5q6 rheumatoid arthritis,'\\*\\* osteoarthritis,9-\" ankylosing spondylitis,'2\\*13 and gout,14 and for the pain of episiotomy.15\\*'6\n\nThe objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy and safety of a fixed combination of meclofenamate, which acts peripherally, and codeine, which acts centrally, and to evaluate whether such a combination is more beneficial than either ingredient acting alone in patients with pain due to oral surgery. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg was compared with its components, with placebo, and with meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg.17\n\nReceived from the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond.\n\n<sup>\\*</sup> Associate Professor.\n\nt Professor and Chairman.\n\nPresented at the American Association for Dental Research, San Francisco, CA, March 1989.\n\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Dr Laskin: Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical College of Virginia, PO Box 566, MCV Station, Richmond, VA 23298- 0566.\n\n**<sup>0 1990</sup> American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons** \n\n**<sup>0278-2391/90/4808-0003\\$3.00/</sup>O** \n\n# Materials and Methods\n\n# **STUDY DESIGN**\n\nThis was a single-dose, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, parallel-treatment study in outpatients with moderate or severe pain **caused**  by the surgical removal of impacted third molars. Before the study, the protocol was approved by the Committee on the Conduct of Human Research of Virginia Commonwealth University. Each patient was supplied with a diary to record information on efficacy and safety over 6 hours following study drug administration and instructed to return it at the next scheduled visit to the study site.\n\n#### **PATIENT SELECTION**\n\nSelected for the study were outpatients at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the Medical College of Virginia, 16 to 37 years old, who were scheduled to undergo the surgical removal of impacted third molars, at least one of which was a partial or full bony impaction. Before participation, each patient signed a written informed consent statement, medical histories were taken, and physical examinations were performed. Patients were excluded from the study if they had medical conditions that contraindicated the use of any of the study medications or if they had known hypersensitivities, allergies, or idiosyncratic reactions to any of the study medications. Female patients were excluded if they were pregnant or nursing. In addition, no patient could be taking any medication that would confound the effects of the study drug or have taken any analgesics or anti-inflammatory agents within a 4-hour period before surgery.\n\n#### **ANESTHETIC REGIMEN**\n\nPatients were treated under local block (mandibular teeth) or infiltration (maxillary teeth) anesthesia using 2% lidocaine with epinephrine l:lOO,OOO supplemented with intravenous diazepam and N20/02 administered by nasal mask. If necessary, methohexital was given intravenously.\n\n# **STUDY MEDICATION**\n\nAll study medications were identical in appearance. Each patient received a single dose consisting of one of the following: 1) one capsule of meclofenamate 100 mg and one of codeine 60 mg, 2) one capsule of meclofenamate 50 mg and one of codeine 30 mg, 3) one capsule of meclofenamate 100 mg and one of placebo, 4) one capsule of codeine 60 mg and\n\none of placebo, or 5) two capsules of placebo. Backup medication of acetaminophen 300 mg plus codeine 30 mg, one or two every 6 hours, was provided to patients for use if additional relief from postsurgical pain was needed.\n\n# **STUDYEVALUATION**\n\nThe efficacy evaluation was based on patient diary records. At 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after taking the study drug, patients rated pain relief and pain intensity. Pain intensity was scored as none = 0, slight = 1, moderate = 2, or severe = 3. Pain relief was scored as none = 0, a little = 1, some = 2, a lot = 3, or complete = 4. Patients also indicated whether the pain was at least half relieved at each of the observation points (yes or no) and gave the time of administration of the backup medication. At the end of the 6-hour study period, each patient evaluated the study drug as excellent = I, very good = 2, good = 3, fair = 4, or poor = 5.\n\nA pain intensity difference (PID) score was calculated for each of the seven posttreatment observation times for each patient by subtracting the posttreatment pain intensity score from the one at baseline (a greater positive score indicates greater improvement). A sum of pain intensity differences (SPID) was then determined by adding the seven PID ratings; a sum of pain relief scores (TOTPAR) was determined in the analogous manner by adding a patient's seven pain relief scores.\n\nThe variables of interest for efficacy were adjusted mean values for SPID and peak PID; TOT-PAR, peak pain relief, number of observations at which pain was half relieved; overall evaluation of study medication effectiveness; and time to remedication with a backup analgesic. The safety evaluation was based on the incidence and severity of adverse experiences that occurred during the 6-hour study period and were recorded in the patient diaries.\n\n# **STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY**\n\nAs treatment groups were significantly different (x2 = 10.46, *P =* .033) with respect to baseline pain intensity, the statistical methodology for the effrcacy data used an ANCOVA with baseline pain intensity as covariate to adjust for this difference. (Although all patients had moderate or severe baseline pain intensity, there were significantly more patients with severe pain in the groups receiving meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg or meclofenamate 100 mg.) Pairwise f-test comparisons were performed on adjusted means. These adjusted mean scores are reported as least square\n\nmeans. Because there were 10 possible pairwise comparisons, a Bonferroni adjusted significance level of 0.005 (0.05 + 10) was used for every pairwise comparison to preserve the overall experiment-wide significance level of 0.05. Computation was performed using the SAS procedure General Linear Model. Summary tables were produced for adverse experience data.\n\n# Results\n\n# PATIENT POPULATION\n\nTwo hundred patients, 35 men and 165 women, were enrolled and received study medication. There were 142 whites (71%), 51 blacks (25.5%), and 7 (3.5%) patients of other races, ranging in age from 16 to 37 years (mean, 22.7). Table 1 shows these data by treatment group, as well as the number of patients in each treatment group. There were no significant differences between study groups in mean time from end of surgery to treatment with study medication.\n\n#### EFFICACY ANALYSES\n\n# *Exclusions From Efficacy Analyses*\n\nThere were no withdrawals among the 200 patients. However, 4 patients were excluded from all efficacy analyses. One patient who received meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg and 2 patients who received codeine were excluded because they took backup medication less than 1 hour after study medication. Another placebo-treated patient was excluded because she took the study medication intended for another patient 30 minutes after she took her own. One additional patient who received meclofenamate 50 mg and codeine 30 mg was excluded from the analyses for TOTPAR and\n\n# Table 1. Patient Characteristics\n\npeak pain value because she had two values for pain relief missing in the first 4 hours following study medication.\n\n# *Pain Intensity*\n\nAdjusted PID scores over 6 hours for each of the five treatment groups are shown in Fig 1. The group that took meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg had the largest mean values (greatest improvement) at each time point, followed by groups receiving meclofenamate 100 mg and meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg. Both codeine and placebo groups showed negative adjusted mean values during most of the study, indicating an increase in pain intensity from baseline: codeine from 2 to 6 hours and placebo from 0.5 to 6 hours.\n\nThe statistical analysis of adjusted mean SPID and adjusted mean peak PID (n = 196) showed that meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg reduced pain intensity significantly more than either codeine or placebo *(P < 0.005)* overall and for peak values. In addition, meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg and meclofenamate 100 mg alone were both statistically superior to placebo for both measures (Table 2).\n\n# *Pain Relief*\n\nAdjusted mean pain relief scores over 6 hours are shown in Fig 2. Meclofenamate plus codeine produced the greatest pain relief over time. The poorest pain relief over time was observed for codeine and placebo: their adjusted mean scores ranged between 0 and 1 (0 = no relief, 1 = a little relief) for codeine at 0.5 and 2 through 6 hours, and for placebo throughout the entire observation period.\n\nThe statistical analysis of adjusted mean TOT-PAR and adjusted mean pain relief demonstrated results analogous to those of adjusted mean SPID\n\n| Variable | Treatment (mg)       |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n|----------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n|          | M1OO+C60<br>,\" = 40) | M 50 + c30<br>(n = 40) | Ml00<br>(II = 41) | C6!l<br>(n = 39) | P<br>(n = 40) | Total<br>(n = 200) |\n| Sex      |                      |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n| Male     | 9                    | 5                      | 11                | 6                | 4             | 35                 |\n| Female   | 31                   | 35                     | 30                | 33               | 36            | 165                |\n| Race     |                      |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n| White    | 31                   | 27                     | 28                | 26               | 30            | 142                |\n| Black    | 8                    | 10                     | 12                | 12               | 9             | 51                 |\n| Other    | 1                    | 3                      | 1                 | 1                | 1             | 7                  |\n| Age      |                      |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n| Mean     | 21.6                 | 23.3                   | 22.8              | 22.9             | 22.7          | 22.7               |\n| Range    | 16-33                | 16-35                  | 16-37             | 16-29            | 16-32         | 16-37              |\n\nAbbreviations: M, meclofenamate; C, codeine; P, placebo.\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nFIGURE 1.

In addition, pain was at least half relieved at significantly more observations with both meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg and meclofenamate alone than with placebo alone. The mean results were meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 3.46 observations; meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, 2.59; meclofenamate 100 mg, 2.51; codeine, 1.52; and placebo, 0.74.\n\n# *Overall Evaluation of Study Drugs*\n\nEach patient evaluated the effectiveness of the study drug (the potential range was 1, excellent, to 5, poor; n = 196). Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg had a significantly larger mean score (P < .005) than codeine or placebo. In addition, both meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg and meclofenamate 100 mg had a significantly better rating than placebo. The mean results were as follows: meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 2.15; meclofenamate IO0 mg, 1.87; meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, 1.65; codeine, 1.15; and placebo, 0.51.\n\n#### *Time to Remedication*\n\nTime to remedication was the time between taking the study medication and taking the backup medication.

The meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, and meclofenamate 100 mg treatment groups had significantly longer adjusted mean times to remedication with a backup analgesic drug (P < .005) than the placebo treatment group (n = 196). The mean times, in hours, were as follows: meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 3.98; meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, 3.78; meclofenamate 100 mg, 3.43; codeine 60 mg, 2.89; and placebo, 1.80.\n\n# SAFETY\n\nA total of 11 adverse events (regardless of possible relation to study drug) were reported by 7 (3.5%) of 200 patients: meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 2 (5.0%) of 40 patients; meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, 4 (10%) of 40 pa-\n\n| Table 3. |                       |  | Adjusted Mean TOTPAR and Peak |\n|----------|-----------------------|--|-------------------------------|\n|          | Pain Relief (n = 195) |  |                               |\n\n| Treatment Group          | Number<br>of<br>Patients | Adjusted<br>Mean<br>TOTPAR | Adjusted<br>Mean Peak<br>Pain Relief |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Meclofenamate<br>100 mg/ |                          |                            |                                      |\n| codeine 60 mg            | 39                       | 12.21*t                    | 3.46*-F                              |\n| Meclofenamate<br>50 mgi  |                          |                            |                                      |\n| codeine 30 mg            | 40                       | 9.ot3*                     | 2.59*                                |\n| Meclofenamate<br>100 mg  | 41                       | 9.19*                      | 2.51*                                |\n| Codeine 60 mg            | 37                       | 4.96                       | 1.52                                 |\n| Placebo                  | 39                       | 2.63                       | 0.74                                 |\n\n\\* Significant difference from codeine (P < .005).\n\nt Significant difference from placebo (P < .005).\n\ntients; and codeine, 1 (2.6%) of 39 patients. None was considered serious. Patients in the meclofenamate 100 mg and placebo treatment groups did not report any adverse experiences. The most common adverse experience was somnolence, which occurred in 1 (2.5%) of the patients who received meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 2 (5.0%) who received meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, and 1 (2.6%) who received codeine 60 mg (Table 4).\n\n#### Discussion\n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) have proven to be effective in relieving postoperative pain.18 Like all members of this class of drugs, meclofenamate acts peripherally by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis and by binding competitively at the prostaglandin receptor sites. Meclofenamate has also been found to be an in vitro inhibitor of human leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase activity. This study was undertaken to determine the feasibility and desirability of combining meclofenamate with codeine to obtain greater pain relief or control than can be achieved with either drug alone in conditions producing moderate or severe pain. Such a fixedcombination product may be clinically advantageous for patients requiring both central and peripheral analgesia.\n\nThe results of this study show that meclofenamate with codeine provides greater pain relief. Patients who received the combination of meclofenamate 100 mg and codeine 60 mg had a better effl-\n\n| Body System,<br>Adverse Event | M 100 + c60<br>(n = 40) | M 50 + C 30<br>(n = 40) | C<br>(n = 39) | Total<br>(n = 200) |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| Body as a whole               |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Headache                      | 0 (0.0)                 | 2 (5.0)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 2 (1.0)            |\n| Digestive system              |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Nausea/vomiting               | 1 (2.5)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 2 (1.0)            |\n| Nervous system                |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Somnolence                    | 1 (2.5)                 | 2 (5.0)                 | 1 (2.6)       | 4 (2.0)            |\n| Psychobiological<br>function  |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Doped-up sensation            | 0 (0.0)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 1 (0.5)            |\n| Hallucinations                | 0 (0.0)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 1 (0.5)            |\n| Thinking abnormal             | 0 (0.0)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 1 (0.5)            |\n\nTable 4.

Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg was also significantly more effective (Z' < .005) than codeine 60 mg for all variables except for the adjusted mean number of observations at which pain was half relieved. The combination of meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg did have a better clinical efficacy response than meclofenamate alone, but not at the stringent *P < .005* significance level.\n\nBoth meclofenamate combinations used in this study were well tolerated. On acute dosage, only 2 of 40 patients with the higher dosage and 4 of 40 with the lower dosage had adverse experiences. The most common symptom was somnolence. Gastrointestinal distress attributed to the combination was reported in only 2 patients.\n\nIn addition to its excellent effect on postsurgical pain, meclofenamate plus codeine has a further advantage not investigated in this study. Because this combination is anti-inflammatory as well as analgesic, it provides an added beneficial effect often required in the postsurgical period. This makes the combination preferable to acetaminophen and codeine, which does not have this property.\n\n# References\n\n- 1.

GIGLIO, DDS, MED,\\* AND DANIEL M. LASKIN, DDS, MSt\n\nA single-dose, randomized, double-blind, parallel-treatment study was performed in 200 outpatients with acute pain caused by the surgical removal of impacted third molars. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, meclofenamate 100 mg, codeine 60 mg, and placebo treatment groups were compared for sum of pain intensity differences, peak pain intensity difference, sum of pain relief scores, peak pain relief, number of observations at which pain was half relieved, overall evaluation of effectiveness, and time to remedication with a backup analgesic. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg was significantly more effective (P < .005) than codeine 60 mg for all variables except number of observations at which pain was half relieved. Both meclofenamate-codeine combinations and meclofenamate 100 mg alone were significantly more effective (P < .005) than placebo for all variables. Eleven adverse experiences were reported in 7 patients (3.5%); the most common was somnolence in 1 patient receiving meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, in 2 treated with meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, and in 1 treated with codeine 60 mg.\n\nMeclofenamate sodium (Meclomen, Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research Division, Warner-Lambert Co, Morris Plains, NJ), a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and competes with formed prostaglandins for receptor sites.

Before the study, the protocol was approved by the Committee on the Conduct of Human Research of Virginia Commonwealth University. Each patient was supplied with a diary to record information on efficacy and safety over 6 hours following study drug administration and instructed to return it at the next scheduled visit to the study site.\n\n#### **PATIENT SELECTION**\n\nSelected for the study were outpatients at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the Medical College of Virginia, 16 to 37 years old, who were scheduled to undergo the surgical removal of impacted third molars, at least one of which was a partial or full bony impaction. Before participation, each patient signed a written informed consent statement, medical histories were taken, and physical examinations were performed. Patients were excluded from the study if they had medical conditions that contraindicated the use of any of the study medications or if they had known hypersensitivities, allergies, or idiosyncratic reactions to any of the study medications. Female patients were excluded if they were pregnant or nursing. In addition, no patient could be taking any medication that would confound the effects of the study drug or have taken any analgesics or anti-inflammatory agents within a 4-hour period before surgery.\n\n#### **ANESTHETIC REGIMEN**\n\nPatients were treated under local block (mandibular teeth) or infiltration (maxillary teeth) anesthesia using 2% lidocaine with epinephrine l:lOO,OOO supplemented with intravenous diazepam and N20/02 administered by nasal mask. If necessary, methohexital was given intravenously.\n\n# **STUDY MEDICATION**\n\nAll study medications were identical in appearance. Each patient received a single dose consisting of one of the following: 1) one capsule of meclofenamate 100 mg and one of codeine 60 mg, 2) one capsule of meclofenamate 50 mg and one of codeine 30 mg, 3) one capsule of meclofenamate 100 mg and one of placebo, 4) one capsule of codeine 60 mg and\n\none of placebo, or 5) two capsules of placebo. Backup medication of acetaminophen 300 mg plus codeine 30 mg, one or two every 6 hours, was provided to patients for use if additional relief from postsurgical pain was needed.\n\n# **STUDYEVALUATION**\n\nThe efficacy evaluation was based on patient diary records. At 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after taking the study drug, patients rated pain relief and pain intensity. Pain intensity was scored as none = 0, slight = 1, moderate = 2, or severe = 3. Pain relief was scored as none = 0, a little = 1, some = 2, a lot = 3, or complete = 4. Patients also indicated whether the pain was at least half relieved at each of the observation points (yes or no) and gave the time of administration of the backup medication. At the end of the 6-hour study period, each patient evaluated the study drug as excellent = I, very good = 2, good = 3, fair = 4, or poor = 5.\n\nA pain intensity difference (PID) score was calculated for each of the seven posttreatment observation times for each patient by subtracting the posttreatment pain intensity score from the one at baseline (a greater positive score indicates greater improvement). A sum of pain intensity differences (SPID) was then determined by adding the seven PID ratings; a sum of pain relief scores (TOTPAR) was determined in the analogous manner by adding a patient's seven pain relief scores.\n\nThe variables of interest for efficacy were adjusted mean values for SPID and peak PID; TOT-PAR, peak pain relief, number of observations at which pain was half relieved; overall evaluation of study medication effectiveness; and time to remedication with a backup analgesic. The safety evaluation was based on the incidence and severity of adverse experiences that occurred during the 6-hour study period and were recorded in the patient diaries.\n\n# **STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY**\n\nAs treatment groups were significantly different (x2 = 10.46, *P =* .033) with respect to baseline pain intensity, the statistical methodology for the effrcacy data used an ANCOVA with baseline pain intensity as covariate to adjust for this difference. (Although all patients had moderate or severe baseline pain intensity, there were significantly more patients with severe pain in the groups receiving meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg or meclofenamate 100 mg.) Pairwise f-test comparisons were performed on adjusted means. These adjusted mean scores are reported as least square\n\nmeans. Because there were 10 possible pairwise comparisons, a Bonferroni adjusted significance level of 0.005 (0.05 + 10) was used for every pairwise comparison to preserve the overall experiment-wide significance level of 0.05. Computation was performed using the SAS procedure General Linear Model. Summary tables were produced for adverse experience data.\n\n# Results\n\n# PATIENT POPULATION\n\nTwo hundred patients, 35 men and 165 women, were enrolled and received study medication. There were 142 whites (71%), 51 blacks (25.5%), and 7 (3.5%) patients of other races, ranging in age from 16 to 37 years (mean, 22.7). Table 1 shows these data by treatment group, as well as the number of patients in each treatment group. There were no significant differences between study groups in mean time from end of surgery to treatment with study medication.\n\n#### EFFICACY ANALYSES\n\n# *Exclusions From Efficacy Analyses*\n\nThere were no withdrawals among the 200 patients. However, 4 patients were excluded from all efficacy analyses. One patient who received meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg and 2 patients who received codeine were excluded because they took backup medication less than 1 hour after study medication. Another placebo-treated patient was excluded because she took the study medication intended for another patient 30 minutes after she took her own. One additional patient who received meclofenamate 50 mg and codeine 30 mg was excluded from the analyses for TOTPAR and\n\n# Table 1. Patient Characteristics\n\npeak pain value because she had two values for pain relief missing in the first 4 hours following study medication.\n\n# *Pain Intensity*\n\nAdjusted PID scores over 6 hours for each of the five treatment groups are shown in Fig 1. The group that took meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg had the largest mean values (greatest improvement) at each time point, followed by groups receiving meclofenamate 100 mg and meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg. Both codeine and placebo groups showed negative adjusted mean values during most of the study, indicating an increase in pain intensity from baseline: codeine from 2 to 6 hours and placebo from 0.5 to 6 hours.\n\nThe statistical analysis of adjusted mean SPID and adjusted mean peak PID (n = 196) showed that meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg reduced pain intensity significantly more than either codeine or placebo *(P < 0.005)* overall and for peak values. In addition, meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg and meclofenamate 100 mg alone were both statistically superior to placebo for both measures (Table 2).\n\n# *Pain Relief*\n\nAdjusted mean pain relief scores over 6 hours are shown in Fig 2. Meclofenamate plus codeine produced the greatest pain relief over time. The poorest pain relief over time was observed for codeine and placebo: their adjusted mean scores ranged between 0 and 1 (0 = no relief, 1 = a little relief) for codeine at 0.5 and 2 through 6 hours, and for placebo throughout the entire observation period.\n\nThe statistical analysis of adjusted mean TOT-PAR and adjusted mean pain relief demonstrated results analogous to those of adjusted mean SPID\n\n| Variable | Treatment (mg)       |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n|----------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n|          | M1OO+C60<br>,\" = 40) | M 50 + c30<br>(n = 40) | Ml00<br>(II = 41) | C6!l<br>(n = 39) | P<br>(n = 40) | Total<br>(n = 200) |\n| Sex      |                      |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n| Male     | 9                    | 5                      | 11                | 6                | 4             | 35                 |\n| Female   | 31                   | 35                     | 30                | 33               | 36            | 165                |\n| Race     |                      |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n| White    | 31                   | 27                     | 28                | 26               | 30            | 142                |\n| Black    | 8                    | 10                     | 12                | 12               | 9             | 51                 |\n| Other    | 1                    | 3                      | 1                 | 1                | 1             | 7                  |\n| Age      |                      |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n| Mean     | 21.6                 | 23.3                   | 22.8              | 22.9             | 22.7          | 22.7               |\n| Range    | 16-33                | 16-35                  | 16-37             | 16-29            | 16-32         | 16-37              |\n\nAbbreviations: M, meclofenamate; C, codeine; P, placebo.\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nFIGURE 1.

The most common adverse experience was somnolence, which occurred in 1 (2.5%) of the patients who received meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 2 (5.0%) who received meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, and 1 (2.6%) who received codeine 60 mg (Table 4).\n\n#### Discussion\n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) have proven to be effective in relieving postoperative pain.18 Like all members of this class of drugs, meclofenamate acts peripherally by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis and by binding competitively at the prostaglandin receptor sites. Meclofenamate has also been found to be an in vitro inhibitor of human leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase activity. This study was undertaken to determine the feasibility and desirability of combining meclofenamate with codeine to obtain greater pain relief or control than can be achieved with either drug alone in conditions producing moderate or severe pain. Such a fixedcombination product may be clinically advantageous for patients requiring both central and peripheral analgesia.\n\nThe results of this study show that meclofenamate with codeine provides greater pain relief. Patients who received the combination of meclofenamate 100 mg and codeine 60 mg had a better effl-\n\n| Body System,<br>Adverse Event | M 100 + c60<br>(n = 40) | M 50 + C 30<br>(n = 40) | C<br>(n = 39) | Total<br>(n = 200) |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| Body as a whole               |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Headache                      | 0 (0.0)                 | 2 (5.0)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 2 (1.0)            |\n| Digestive system              |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Nausea/vomiting               | 1 (2.5)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 2 (1.0)            |\n| Nervous system                |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Somnolence                    | 1 (2.5)                 | 2 (5.0)                 | 1 (2.6)       | 4 (2.0)            |\n| Psychobiological<br>function  |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Doped-up sensation            | 0 (0.0)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 1 (0.5)            |\n| Hallucinations                | 0 (0.0)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 1 (0.5)            |\n| Thinking abnormal             | 0 (0.0)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 1 (0.5)            |\n\nTable 4.

Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg was also significantly more effective (Z' < .005) than codeine 60 mg for all variables except for the adjusted mean number of observations at which pain was half relieved. The combination of meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg did have a better clinical efficacy response than meclofenamate alone, but not at the stringent *P < .005* significance level.\n\nBoth meclofenamate combinations used in this study were well tolerated. On acute dosage, only 2 of 40 patients with the higher dosage and 4 of 40 with the lower dosage had adverse experiences. The most common symptom was somnolence. Gastrointestinal distress attributed to the combination was reported in only 2 patients.\n\nIn addition to its excellent effect on postsurgical pain, meclofenamate plus codeine has a further advantage not investigated in this study. Because this combination is anti-inflammatory as well as analgesic, it provides an added beneficial effect often required in the postsurgical period. This makes the combination preferable to acetaminophen and codeine, which does not have this property.\n\n# References\n\n- 1.

GIGLIO, DDS, MED,\\* AND DANIEL M. LASKIN, DDS, MSt\n\nA single-dose, randomized, double-blind, parallel-treatment study was performed in 200 outpatients with acute pain caused by the surgical removal of impacted third molars. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, meclofenamate 100 mg, codeine 60 mg, and placebo treatment groups were compared for sum of pain intensity differences, peak pain intensity difference, sum of pain relief scores, peak pain relief, number of observations at which pain was half relieved, overall evaluation of effectiveness, and time to remedication with a backup analgesic. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg was significantly more effective (P < .005) than codeine 60 mg for all variables except number of observations at which pain was half relieved. Both meclofenamate-codeine combinations and meclofenamate 100 mg alone were significantly more effective (P < .005) than placebo for all variables. Eleven adverse experiences were reported in 7 patients (3.5%); the most common was somnolence in 1 patient receiving meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, in 2 treated with meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, and in 1 treated with codeine 60 mg.\n\nMeclofenamate sodium (Meclomen, Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research Division, Warner-Lambert Co, Morris Plains, NJ), a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and competes with formed prostaglandins for receptor sites. L-4 It has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Published literature provides evidence that meclofenamate is safe and effective in the treatment of patients with acute dental pain following third molar extraction,5q6 rheumatoid arthritis,'\\*\\* osteoarthritis,9-\" ankylosing spondylitis,'2\\*13 and gout,14 and for the pain of episiotomy.15\\*'6\n\nThe objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy and safety of a fixed combination of meclofenamate, which acts peripherally, and codeine, which acts centrally, and to evaluate whether such a combination is more beneficial than either ingredient acting alone in patients with pain due to oral surgery. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg was compared with its components, with placebo, and with meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg.17\n\nReceived from the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond.\n\n<sup>\\*</sup> Associate Professor.\n\nt Professor and Chairman.\n\nPresented at the American Association for Dental Research, San Francisco, CA, March 1989.\n\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Dr Laskin: Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical College of Virginia, PO Box 566, MCV Station, Richmond, VA 23298- 0566.\n\n**<sup>0 1990</sup> American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons** \n\n**<sup>0278-2391/90/4808-0003\\$3.00/</sup>O** \n\n# Materials and Methods\n\n# **STUDY DESIGN**\n\nThis was a single-dose, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, parallel-treatment study in outpatients with moderate or severe pain **caused**  by the surgical removal of impacted third molars. Before the study, the protocol was approved by the Committee on the Conduct of Human Research of Virginia Commonwealth University. Each patient was supplied with a diary to record information on efficacy and safety over 6 hours following study drug administration and instructed to return it at the next scheduled visit to the study site.\n\n#### **PATIENT SELECTION**\n\nSelected for the study were outpatients at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the Medical College of Virginia, 16 to 37 years old, who were scheduled to undergo the surgical removal of impacted third molars, at least one of which was a partial or full bony impaction. Before participation, each patient signed a written informed consent statement, medical histories were taken, and physical examinations were performed. Patients were excluded from the study if they had medical conditions that contraindicated the use of any of the study medications or if they had known hypersensitivities, allergies, or idiosyncratic reactions to any of the study medications. Female patients were excluded if they were pregnant or nursing. In addition, no patient could be taking any medication that would confound the effects of the study drug or have taken any analgesics or anti-inflammatory agents within a 4-hour period before surgery.\n\n#### **ANESTHETIC REGIMEN**\n\nPatients were treated under local block (mandibular teeth) or infiltration (maxillary teeth) anesthesia using 2% lidocaine with epinephrine l:lOO,OOO supplemented with intravenous diazepam and N20/02 administered by nasal mask. If necessary, methohexital was given intravenously.\n\n# **STUDY MEDICATION**\n\nAll study medications were identical in appearance. Each patient received a single dose consisting of one of the following: 1) one capsule of meclofenamate 100 mg and one of codeine 60 mg, 2) one capsule of meclofenamate 50 mg and one of codeine 30 mg, 3) one capsule of meclofenamate 100 mg and one of placebo, 4) one capsule of codeine 60 mg and\n\none of placebo, or 5) two capsules of placebo. Backup medication of acetaminophen 300 mg plus codeine 30 mg, one or two every 6 hours, was provided to patients for use if additional relief from postsurgical pain was needed.\n\n# **STUDYEVALUATION**\n\nThe efficacy evaluation was based on patient diary records. At 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after taking the study drug, patients rated pain relief and pain intensity. Pain intensity was scored as none = 0, slight = 1, moderate = 2, or severe = 3. Pain relief was scored as none = 0, a little = 1, some = 2, a lot = 3, or complete = 4. Patients also indicated whether the pain was at least half relieved at each of the observation points (yes or no) and gave the time of administration of the backup medication. At the end of the 6-hour study period, each patient evaluated the study drug as excellent = I, very good = 2, good = 3, fair = 4, or poor = 5.\n\nA pain intensity difference (PID) score was calculated for each of the seven posttreatment observation times for each patient by subtracting the posttreatment pain intensity score from the one at baseline (a greater positive score indicates greater improvement). A sum of pain intensity differences (SPID) was then determined by adding the seven PID ratings; a sum of pain relief scores (TOTPAR) was determined in the analogous manner by adding a patient's seven pain relief scores.\n\nThe variables of interest for efficacy were adjusted mean values for SPID and peak PID; TOT-PAR, peak pain relief, number of observations at which pain was half relieved; overall evaluation of study medication effectiveness; and time to remedication with a backup analgesic. The safety evaluation was based on the incidence and severity of adverse experiences that occurred during the 6-hour study period and were recorded in the patient diaries.\n\n# **STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY**\n\nAs treatment groups were significantly different (x2 = 10.46, *P =* .033) with respect to baseline pain intensity, the statistical methodology for the effrcacy data used an ANCOVA with baseline pain intensity as covariate to adjust for this difference. (Although all patients had moderate or severe baseline pain intensity, there were significantly more patients with severe pain in the groups receiving meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg or meclofenamate 100 mg.) Pairwise f-test comparisons were performed on adjusted means. These adjusted mean scores are reported as least square\n\nmeans. Because there were 10 possible pairwise comparisons, a Bonferroni adjusted significance level of 0.005 (0.05 + 10) was used for every pairwise comparison to preserve the overall experiment-wide significance level of 0.05. Computation was performed using the SAS procedure General Linear Model. Summary tables were produced for adverse experience data.\n\n# Results\n\n# PATIENT POPULATION\n\nTwo hundred patients, 35 men and 165 women, were enrolled and received study medication. There were 142 whites (71%), 51 blacks (25.5%), and 7 (3.5%) patients of other races, ranging in age from 16 to 37 years (mean, 22.7). Table 1 shows these data by treatment group, as well as the number of patients in each treatment group. There were no significant differences between study groups in mean time from end of surgery to treatment with study medication.\n\n#### EFFICACY ANALYSES\n\n# *Exclusions From Efficacy Analyses*\n\nThere were no withdrawals among the 200 patients. However, 4 patients were excluded from all efficacy analyses. One patient who received meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg and 2 patients who received codeine were excluded because they took backup medication less than 1 hour after study medication. Another placebo-treated patient was excluded because she took the study medication intended for another patient 30 minutes after she took her own. One additional patient who received meclofenamate 50 mg and codeine 30 mg was excluded from the analyses for TOTPAR and\n\n# Table 1. Patient Characteristics\n\npeak pain value because she had two values for pain relief missing in the first 4 hours following study medication.\n\n# *Pain Intensity*\n\nAdjusted PID scores over 6 hours for each of the five treatment groups are shown in Fig 1. The group that took meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg had the largest mean values (greatest improvement) at each time point, followed by groups receiving meclofenamate 100 mg and meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg. Both codeine and placebo groups showed negative adjusted mean values during most of the study, indicating an increase in pain intensity from baseline: codeine from 2 to 6 hours and placebo from 0.5 to 6 hours.\n\nThe statistical analysis of adjusted mean SPID and adjusted mean peak PID (n = 196) showed that meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg reduced pain intensity significantly more than either codeine or placebo *(P < 0.005)* overall and for peak values. In addition, meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg and meclofenamate 100 mg alone were both statistically superior to placebo for both measures (Table 2).\n\n# *Pain Relief*\n\nAdjusted mean pain relief scores over 6 hours are shown in Fig 2. Meclofenamate plus codeine produced the greatest pain relief over time. The poorest pain relief over time was observed for codeine and placebo: their adjusted mean scores ranged between 0 and 1 (0 = no relief, 1 = a little relief) for codeine at 0.5 and 2 through 6 hours, and for placebo throughout the entire observation period.\n\nThe statistical analysis of adjusted mean TOT-PAR and adjusted mean pain relief demonstrated results analogous to those of adjusted mean SPID\n\n| Variable | Treatment (mg)       |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n|----------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n|          | M1OO+C60<br>,\" = 40) | M 50 + c30<br>(n = 40) | Ml00<br>(II = 41) | C6!l<br>(n = 39) | P<br>(n = 40) | Total<br>(n = 200) |\n| Sex      |                      |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n| Male     | 9                    | 5                      | 11                | 6                | 4             | 35                 |\n| Female   | 31                   | 35                     | 30                | 33               | 36            | 165                |\n| Race     |                      |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n| White    | 31                   | 27                     | 28                | 26               | 30            | 142                |\n| Black    | 8                    | 10                     | 12                | 12               | 9             | 51                 |\n| Other    | 1                    | 3                      | 1                 | 1                | 1             | 7                  |\n| Age      |                      |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n| Mean     | 21.6                 | 23.3                   | 22.8              | 22.9             | 22.7          | 22.7               |\n| Range    | 16-33                | 16-35                  | 16-37             | 16-29            | 16-32         | 16-37              |\n\nAbbreviations: M, meclofenamate; C, codeine; P, placebo.\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nFIGURE 1.

Patients who took meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg had a significantly greater adjusted mean number of observations (P < .005) with pain at least\n\n| Table 2.  | Adjusted Mean SPID and Peak PID |  |  |  |\n|-----------|---------------------------------|--|--|--|\n| (n = 1SS) |                                 |  |  |  |\n\n| Treatment Group                           | Number<br>of<br>Patients | Adjusted<br>Mean<br>SPID | Adjusted<br>Mean Peak<br>PID |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Meclofenamate<br>100 mpl<br>codeine 60 mg | 39                       | 4.48*+                   | 1.29*t                       |\n| Meclofenamate<br>50 mgl                   |                          |                          |                              |\n| codeine 30 mg                             | 40                       | 2.22*                    | 1.08*                        |\n| Meclofenamate<br>100 mg                   | 41                       | 2.11*                    | 1.04*                        |\n| Codeine 60 mg                             | 37                       | -0.14                    | 0.64                         |\n| Placebo                                   | 39                       | -2.89                    | 0.16                         |\n\n\\* Significant difference from codeine (P < ,005).\n\nt Signiticant difference from placebo (P < .OO5).\n\nhalf relieved than did patients who took codeine or placebo. In addition, pain was at least half relieved at significantly more observations with both meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg and meclofenamate alone than with placebo alone. The mean results were meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 3.46 observations; meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, 2.59; meclofenamate 100 mg, 2.51; codeine, 1.52; and placebo, 0.74.\n\n# *Overall Evaluation of Study Drugs*\n\nEach patient evaluated the effectiveness of the study drug (the potential range was 1, excellent, to 5, poor; n = 196).

The most common adverse experience was somnolence, which occurred in 1 (2.5%) of the patients who received meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 2 (5.0%) who received meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, and 1 (2.6%) who received codeine 60 mg (Table 4).\n\n#### Discussion\n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) have proven to be effective in relieving postoperative pain.18 Like all members of this class of drugs, meclofenamate acts peripherally by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis and by binding competitively at the prostaglandin receptor sites. Meclofenamate has also been found to be an in vitro inhibitor of human leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase activity. This study was undertaken to determine the feasibility and desirability of combining meclofenamate with codeine to obtain greater pain relief or control than can be achieved with either drug alone in conditions producing moderate or severe pain. Such a fixedcombination product may be clinically advantageous for patients requiring both central and peripheral analgesia.\n\nThe results of this study show that meclofenamate with codeine provides greater pain relief. Patients who received the combination of meclofenamate 100 mg and codeine 60 mg had a better effl-\n\n| Body System,<br>Adverse Event | M 100 + c60<br>(n = 40) | M 50 + C 30<br>(n = 40) | C<br>(n = 39) | Total<br>(n = 200) |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| Body as a whole               |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Headache                      | 0 (0.0)                 | 2 (5.0)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 2 (1.0)            |\n| Digestive system              |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Nausea/vomiting               | 1 (2.5)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 2 (1.0)            |\n| Nervous system                |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Somnolence                    | 1 (2.5)                 | 2 (5.0)                 | 1 (2.6)       | 4 (2.0)            |\n| Psychobiological<br>function  |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Doped-up sensation            | 0 (0.0)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 1 (0.5)            |\n| Hallucinations                | 0 (0.0)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 1 (0.5)            |\n| Thinking abnormal             | 0 (0.0)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 1 (0.5)            |\n\nTable 4.

Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg was also significantly more effective (Z' < .005) than codeine 60 mg for all variables except for the adjusted mean number of observations at which pain was half relieved. The combination of meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg did have a better clinical efficacy response than meclofenamate alone, but not at the stringent *P < .005* significance level.\n\nBoth meclofenamate combinations used in this study were well tolerated. On acute dosage, only 2 of 40 patients with the higher dosage and 4 of 40 with the lower dosage had adverse experiences. The most common symptom was somnolence. Gastrointestinal distress attributed to the combination was reported in only 2 patients.\n\nIn addition to its excellent effect on postsurgical pain, meclofenamate plus codeine has a further advantage not investigated in this study. Because this combination is anti-inflammatory as well as analgesic, it provides an added beneficial effect often required in the postsurgical period. This makes the combination preferable to acetaminophen and codeine, which does not have this property.\n\n# References\n\n- 1.

GIGLIO, DDS, MED,\\* AND DANIEL M. LASKIN, DDS, MSt\n\nA single-dose, randomized, double-blind, parallel-treatment study was performed in 200 outpatients with acute pain caused by the surgical removal of impacted third molars. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, meclofenamate 100 mg, codeine 60 mg, and placebo treatment groups were compared for sum of pain intensity differences, peak pain intensity difference, sum of pain relief scores, peak pain relief, number of observations at which pain was half relieved, overall evaluation of effectiveness, and time to remedication with a backup analgesic. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg was significantly more effective (P < .005) than codeine 60 mg for all variables except number of observations at which pain was half relieved. Both meclofenamate-codeine combinations and meclofenamate 100 mg alone were significantly more effective (P < .005) than placebo for all variables. Eleven adverse experiences were reported in 7 patients (3.5%); the most common was somnolence in 1 patient receiving meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, in 2 treated with meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, and in 1 treated with codeine 60 mg.\n\nMeclofenamate sodium (Meclomen, Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research Division, Warner-Lambert Co, Morris Plains, NJ), a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and competes with formed prostaglandins for receptor sites. L-4 It has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Published literature provides evidence that meclofenamate is safe and effective in the treatment of patients with acute dental pain following third molar extraction,5q6 rheumatoid arthritis,'\\*\\* osteoarthritis,9-\" ankylosing spondylitis,'2\\*13 and gout,14 and for the pain of episiotomy.15\\*'6\n\nThe objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy and safety of a fixed combination of meclofenamate, which acts peripherally, and codeine, which acts centrally, and to evaluate whether such a combination is more beneficial than either ingredient acting alone in patients with pain due to oral surgery. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg was compared with its components, with placebo, and with meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg.17\n\nReceived from the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond.\n\n<sup>\\*</sup> Associate Professor.\n\nt Professor and Chairman.\n\nPresented at the American Association for Dental Research, San Francisco, CA, March 1989.\n\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Dr Laskin: Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical College of Virginia, PO Box 566, MCV Station, Richmond, VA 23298- 0566.\n\n**<sup>0 1990</sup> American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons** \n\n**<sup>0278-2391/90/4808-0003\\$3.00/</sup>O** \n\n# Materials and Methods\n\n# **STUDY DESIGN**\n\nThis was a single-dose, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, parallel-treatment study in outpatients with moderate or severe pain **caused**  by the surgical removal of impacted third molars. Before the study, the protocol was approved by the Committee on the Conduct of Human Research of Virginia Commonwealth University. Each patient was supplied with a diary to record information on efficacy and safety over 6 hours following study drug administration and instructed to return it at the next scheduled visit to the study site.\n\n#### **PATIENT SELECTION**\n\nSelected for the study were outpatients at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the Medical College of Virginia, 16 to 37 years old, who were scheduled to undergo the surgical removal of impacted third molars, at least one of which was a partial or full bony impaction. Before participation, each patient signed a written informed consent statement, medical histories were taken, and physical examinations were performed. Patients were excluded from the study if they had medical conditions that contraindicated the use of any of the study medications or if they had known hypersensitivities, allergies, or idiosyncratic reactions to any of the study medications. Female patients were excluded if they were pregnant or nursing. In addition, no patient could be taking any medication that would confound the effects of the study drug or have taken any analgesics or anti-inflammatory agents within a 4-hour period before surgery.\n\n#### **ANESTHETIC REGIMEN**\n\nPatients were treated under local block (mandibular teeth) or infiltration (maxillary teeth) anesthesia using 2% lidocaine with epinephrine l:lOO,OOO supplemented with intravenous diazepam and N20/02 administered by nasal mask. If necessary, methohexital was given intravenously.\n\n# **STUDY MEDICATION**\n\nAll study medications were identical in appearance. Each patient received a single dose consisting of one of the following: 1) one capsule of meclofenamate 100 mg and one of codeine 60 mg, 2) one capsule of meclofenamate 50 mg and one of codeine 30 mg, 3) one capsule of meclofenamate 100 mg and one of placebo, 4) one capsule of codeine 60 mg and\n\none of placebo, or 5) two capsules of placebo. Backup medication of acetaminophen 300 mg plus codeine 30 mg, one or two every 6 hours, was provided to patients for use if additional relief from postsurgical pain was needed.\n\n# **STUDYEVALUATION**\n\nThe efficacy evaluation was based on patient diary records. At 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after taking the study drug, patients rated pain relief and pain intensity. Pain intensity was scored as none = 0, slight = 1, moderate = 2, or severe = 3. Pain relief was scored as none = 0, a little = 1, some = 2, a lot = 3, or complete = 4. Patients also indicated whether the pain was at least half relieved at each of the observation points (yes or no) and gave the time of administration of the backup medication. At the end of the 6-hour study period, each patient evaluated the study drug as excellent = I, very good = 2, good = 3, fair = 4, or poor = 5.\n\nA pain intensity difference (PID) score was calculated for each of the seven posttreatment observation times for each patient by subtracting the posttreatment pain intensity score from the one at baseline (a greater positive score indicates greater improvement). A sum of pain intensity differences (SPID) was then determined by adding the seven PID ratings; a sum of pain relief scores (TOTPAR) was determined in the analogous manner by adding a patient's seven pain relief scores.\n\nThe variables of interest for efficacy were adjusted mean values for SPID and peak PID; TOT-PAR, peak pain relief, number of observations at which pain was half relieved; overall evaluation of study medication effectiveness; and time to remedication with a backup analgesic. The safety evaluation was based on the incidence and severity of adverse experiences that occurred during the 6-hour study period and were recorded in the patient diaries.\n\n# **STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY**\n\nAs treatment groups were significantly different (x2 = 10.46, *P =* .033) with respect to baseline pain intensity, the statistical methodology for the effrcacy data used an ANCOVA with baseline pain intensity as covariate to adjust for this difference. (Although all patients had moderate or severe baseline pain intensity, there were significantly more patients with severe pain in the groups receiving meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg or meclofenamate 100 mg.) Pairwise f-test comparisons were performed on adjusted means. These adjusted mean scores are reported as least square\n\nmeans. Because there were 10 possible pairwise comparisons, a Bonferroni adjusted significance level of 0.005 (0.05 + 10) was used for every pairwise comparison to preserve the overall experiment-wide significance level of 0.05. Computation was performed using the SAS procedure General Linear Model. Summary tables were produced for adverse experience data.\n\n# Results\n\n# PATIENT POPULATION\n\nTwo hundred patients, 35 men and 165 women, were enrolled and received study medication. There were 142 whites (71%), 51 blacks (25.5%), and 7 (3.5%) patients of other races, ranging in age from 16 to 37 years (mean, 22.7). Table 1 shows these data by treatment group, as well as the number of patients in each treatment group. There were no significant differences between study groups in mean time from end of surgery to treatment with study medication.\n\n#### EFFICACY ANALYSES\n\n# *Exclusions From Efficacy Analyses*\n\nThere were no withdrawals among the 200 patients. However, 4 patients were excluded from all efficacy analyses. One patient who received meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg and 2 patients who received codeine were excluded because they took backup medication less than 1 hour after study medication. Another placebo-treated patient was excluded because she took the study medication intended for another patient 30 minutes after she took her own. One additional patient who received meclofenamate 50 mg and codeine 30 mg was excluded from the analyses for TOTPAR and\n\n# Table 1. Patient Characteristics\n\npeak pain value because she had two values for pain relief missing in the first 4 hours following study medication.\n\n# *Pain Intensity*\n\nAdjusted PID scores over 6 hours for each of the five treatment groups are shown in Fig 1. The group that took meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg had the largest mean values (greatest improvement) at each time point, followed by groups receiving meclofenamate 100 mg and meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg. Both codeine and placebo groups showed negative adjusted mean values during most of the study, indicating an increase in pain intensity from baseline: codeine from 2 to 6 hours and placebo from 0.5 to 6 hours.\n\nThe statistical analysis of adjusted mean SPID and adjusted mean peak PID (n = 196) showed that meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg reduced pain intensity significantly more than either codeine or placebo *(P < 0.005)* overall and for peak values. In addition, meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg and meclofenamate 100 mg alone were both statistically superior to placebo for both measures (Table 2).\n\n# *Pain Relief*\n\nAdjusted mean pain relief scores over 6 hours are shown in Fig 2. Meclofenamate plus codeine produced the greatest pain relief over time. The poorest pain relief over time was observed for codeine and placebo: their adjusted mean scores ranged between 0 and 1 (0 = no relief, 1 = a little relief) for codeine at 0.5 and 2 through 6 hours, and for placebo throughout the entire observation period.\n\nThe statistical analysis of adjusted mean TOT-PAR and adjusted mean pain relief demonstrated results analogous to those of adjusted mean SPID\n\n| Variable | Treatment (mg)       |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n|----------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n|          | M1OO+C60<br>,\" = 40) | M 50 + c30<br>(n = 40) | Ml00<br>(II = 41) | C6!l<br>(n = 39) | P<br>(n = 40) | Total<br>(n = 200) |\n| Sex      |                      |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n| Male     | 9                    | 5                      | 11                | 6                | 4             | 35                 |\n| Female   | 31                   | 35                     | 30                | 33               | 36            | 165                |\n| Race     |                      |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n| White    | 31                   | 27                     | 28                | 26               | 30            | 142                |\n| Black    | 8                    | 10                     | 12                | 12               | 9             | 51                 |\n| Other    | 1                    | 3                      | 1                 | 1                | 1             | 7                  |\n| Age      |                      |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n| Mean     | 21.6                 | 23.3                   | 22.8              | 22.9             | 22.7          | 22.7               |\n| Range    | 16-33                | 16-35                  | 16-37             | 16-29            | 16-32         | 16-37              |\n\nAbbreviations: M, meclofenamate; C, codeine; P, placebo.\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nFIGURE 1.

The mean results were meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 3.46 observations; meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, 2.59; meclofenamate 100 mg, 2.51; codeine, 1.52; and placebo, 0.74.\n\n# *Overall Evaluation of Study Drugs*\n\nEach patient evaluated the effectiveness of the study drug (the potential range was 1, excellent, to 5, poor; n = 196). Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg had a significantly larger mean score (P < .005) than codeine or placebo. In addition, both meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg and meclofenamate 100 mg had a significantly better rating than placebo. The mean results were as follows: meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 2.15; meclofenamate IO0 mg, 1.87; meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, 1.65; codeine, 1.15; and placebo, 0.51.\n\n#### *Time to Remedication*\n\nTime to remedication was the time between taking the study medication and taking the backup medication.

The most common adverse experience was somnolence, which occurred in 1 (2.5%) of the patients who received meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 2 (5.0%) who received meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, and 1 (2.6%) who received codeine 60 mg (Table 4).\n\n#### Discussion\n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) have proven to be effective in relieving postoperative pain.18 Like all members of this class of drugs, meclofenamate acts peripherally by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis and by binding competitively at the prostaglandin receptor sites. Meclofenamate has also been found to be an in vitro inhibitor of human leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase activity. This study was undertaken to determine the feasibility and desirability of combining meclofenamate with codeine to obtain greater pain relief or control than can be achieved with either drug alone in conditions producing moderate or severe pain. Such a fixedcombination product may be clinically advantageous for patients requiring both central and peripheral analgesia.\n\nThe results of this study show that meclofenamate with codeine provides greater pain relief. Patients who received the combination of meclofenamate 100 mg and codeine 60 mg had a better effl-\n\n| Body System,<br>Adverse Event | M 100 + c60<br>(n = 40) | M 50 + C 30<br>(n = 40) | C<br>(n = 39) | Total<br>(n = 200) |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| Body as a whole               |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Headache                      | 0 (0.0)                 | 2 (5.0)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 2 (1.0)            |\n| Digestive system              |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Nausea/vomiting               | 1 (2.5)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 2 (1.0)            |\n| Nervous system                |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Somnolence                    | 1 (2.5)                 | 2 (5.0)                 | 1 (2.6)       | 4 (2.0)            |\n| Psychobiological<br>function  |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Doped-up sensation            | 0 (0.0)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 1 (0.5)            |\n| Hallucinations                | 0 (0.0)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 1 (0.5)            |\n| Thinking abnormal             | 0 (0.0)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 1 (0.5)            |\n\nTable 4.

Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg was also significantly more effective (Z' < .005) than codeine 60 mg for all variables except for the adjusted mean number of observations at which pain was half relieved. The combination of meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg did have a better clinical efficacy response than meclofenamate alone, but not at the stringent *P < .005* significance level.\n\nBoth meclofenamate combinations used in this study were well tolerated. On acute dosage, only 2 of 40 patients with the higher dosage and 4 of 40 with the lower dosage had adverse experiences. The most common symptom was somnolence. Gastrointestinal distress attributed to the combination was reported in only 2 patients.\n\nIn addition to its excellent effect on postsurgical pain, meclofenamate plus codeine has a further advantage not investigated in this study. Because this combination is anti-inflammatory as well as analgesic, it provides an added beneficial effect often required in the postsurgical period. This makes the combination preferable to acetaminophen and codeine, which does not have this property.\n\n# References\n\n- 1.

GIGLIO, DDS, MED,\\* AND DANIEL M. LASKIN, DDS, MSt\n\nA single-dose, randomized, double-blind, parallel-treatment study was performed in 200 outpatients with acute pain caused by the surgical removal of impacted third molars. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, meclofenamate 100 mg, codeine 60 mg, and placebo treatment groups were compared for sum of pain intensity differences, peak pain intensity difference, sum of pain relief scores, peak pain relief, number of observations at which pain was half relieved, overall evaluation of effectiveness, and time to remedication with a backup analgesic. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg was significantly more effective (P < .005) than codeine 60 mg for all variables except number of observations at which pain was half relieved. Both meclofenamate-codeine combinations and meclofenamate 100 mg alone were significantly more effective (P < .005) than placebo for all variables. Eleven adverse experiences were reported in 7 patients (3.5%); the most common was somnolence in 1 patient receiving meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, in 2 treated with meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, and in 1 treated with codeine 60 mg.\n\nMeclofenamate sodium (Meclomen, Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research Division, Warner-Lambert Co, Morris Plains, NJ), a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and competes with formed prostaglandins for receptor sites. L-4 It has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Published literature provides evidence that meclofenamate is safe and effective in the treatment of patients with acute dental pain following third molar extraction,5q6 rheumatoid arthritis,'\\*\\* osteoarthritis,9-\" ankylosing spondylitis,'2\\*13 and gout,14 and for the pain of episiotomy.15\\*'6\n\nThe objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy and safety of a fixed combination of meclofenamate, which acts peripherally, and codeine, which acts centrally, and to evaluate whether such a combination is more beneficial than either ingredient acting alone in patients with pain due to oral surgery. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg was compared with its components, with placebo, and with meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg.17\n\nReceived from the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond.\n\n<sup>\\*</sup> Associate Professor.\n\nt Professor and Chairman.\n\nPresented at the American Association for Dental Research, San Francisco, CA, March 1989.\n\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Dr Laskin: Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical College of Virginia, PO Box 566, MCV Station, Richmond, VA 23298- 0566.\n\n**<sup>0 1990</sup> American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons** \n\n**<sup>0278-2391/90/4808-0003\\$3.00/</sup>O** \n\n# Materials and Methods\n\n# **STUDY DESIGN**\n\nThis was a single-dose, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, parallel-treatment study in outpatients with moderate or severe pain **caused**  by the surgical removal of impacted third molars. Before the study, the protocol was approved by the Committee on the Conduct of Human Research of Virginia Commonwealth University. Each patient was supplied with a diary to record information on efficacy and safety over 6 hours following study drug administration and instructed to return it at the next scheduled visit to the study site.\n\n#### **PATIENT SELECTION**\n\nSelected for the study were outpatients at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the Medical College of Virginia, 16 to 37 years old, who were scheduled to undergo the surgical removal of impacted third molars, at least one of which was a partial or full bony impaction. Before participation, each patient signed a written informed consent statement, medical histories were taken, and physical examinations were performed. Patients were excluded from the study if they had medical conditions that contraindicated the use of any of the study medications or if they had known hypersensitivities, allergies, or idiosyncratic reactions to any of the study medications. Female patients were excluded if they were pregnant or nursing. In addition, no patient could be taking any medication that would confound the effects of the study drug or have taken any analgesics or anti-inflammatory agents within a 4-hour period before surgery.\n\n#### **ANESTHETIC REGIMEN**\n\nPatients were treated under local block (mandibular teeth) or infiltration (maxillary teeth) anesthesia using 2% lidocaine with epinephrine l:lOO,OOO supplemented with intravenous diazepam and N20/02 administered by nasal mask. If necessary, methohexital was given intravenously.\n\n# **STUDY MEDICATION**\n\nAll study medications were identical in appearance. Each patient received a single dose consisting of one of the following: 1) one capsule of meclofenamate 100 mg and one of codeine 60 mg, 2) one capsule of meclofenamate 50 mg and one of codeine 30 mg, 3) one capsule of meclofenamate 100 mg and one of placebo, 4) one capsule of codeine 60 mg and\n\none of placebo, or 5) two capsules of placebo. Backup medication of acetaminophen 300 mg plus codeine 30 mg, one or two every 6 hours, was provided to patients for use if additional relief from postsurgical pain was needed.\n\n# **STUDYEVALUATION**\n\nThe efficacy evaluation was based on patient diary records. At 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after taking the study drug, patients rated pain relief and pain intensity. Pain intensity was scored as none = 0, slight = 1, moderate = 2, or severe = 3. Pain relief was scored as none = 0, a little = 1, some = 2, a lot = 3, or complete = 4. Patients also indicated whether the pain was at least half relieved at each of the observation points (yes or no) and gave the time of administration of the backup medication. At the end of the 6-hour study period, each patient evaluated the study drug as excellent = I, very good = 2, good = 3, fair = 4, or poor = 5.\n\nA pain intensity difference (PID) score was calculated for each of the seven posttreatment observation times for each patient by subtracting the posttreatment pain intensity score from the one at baseline (a greater positive score indicates greater improvement). A sum of pain intensity differences (SPID) was then determined by adding the seven PID ratings; a sum of pain relief scores (TOTPAR) was determined in the analogous manner by adding a patient's seven pain relief scores.\n\nThe variables of interest for efficacy were adjusted mean values for SPID and peak PID; TOT-PAR, peak pain relief, number of observations at which pain was half relieved; overall evaluation of study medication effectiveness; and time to remedication with a backup analgesic. The safety evaluation was based on the incidence and severity of adverse experiences that occurred during the 6-hour study period and were recorded in the patient diaries.\n\n# **STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY**\n\nAs treatment groups were significantly different (x2 = 10.46, *P =* .033) with respect to baseline pain intensity, the statistical methodology for the effrcacy data used an ANCOVA with baseline pain intensity as covariate to adjust for this difference. (Although all patients had moderate or severe baseline pain intensity, there were significantly more patients with severe pain in the groups receiving meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg or meclofenamate 100 mg.) Pairwise f-test comparisons were performed on adjusted means. These adjusted mean scores are reported as least square\n\nmeans. Because there were 10 possible pairwise comparisons, a Bonferroni adjusted significance level of 0.005 (0.05 + 10) was used for every pairwise comparison to preserve the overall experiment-wide significance level of 0.05. Computation was performed using the SAS procedure General Linear Model. Summary tables were produced for adverse experience data.\n\n# Results\n\n# PATIENT POPULATION\n\nTwo hundred patients, 35 men and 165 women, were enrolled and received study medication. There were 142 whites (71%), 51 blacks (25.5%), and 7 (3.5%) patients of other races, ranging in age from 16 to 37 years (mean, 22.7). Table 1 shows these data by treatment group, as well as the number of patients in each treatment group. There were no significant differences between study groups in mean time from end of surgery to treatment with study medication.\n\n#### EFFICACY ANALYSES\n\n# *Exclusions From Efficacy Analyses*\n\nThere were no withdrawals among the 200 patients. However, 4 patients were excluded from all efficacy analyses. One patient who received meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg and 2 patients who received codeine were excluded because they took backup medication less than 1 hour after study medication. Another placebo-treated patient was excluded because she took the study medication intended for another patient 30 minutes after she took her own. One additional patient who received meclofenamate 50 mg and codeine 30 mg was excluded from the analyses for TOTPAR and\n\n# Table 1. Patient Characteristics\n\npeak pain value because she had two values for pain relief missing in the first 4 hours following study medication.\n\n# *Pain Intensity*\n\nAdjusted PID scores over 6 hours for each of the five treatment groups are shown in Fig 1. The group that took meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg had the largest mean values (greatest improvement) at each time point, followed by groups receiving meclofenamate 100 mg and meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg. Both codeine and placebo groups showed negative adjusted mean values during most of the study, indicating an increase in pain intensity from baseline: codeine from 2 to 6 hours and placebo from 0.5 to 6 hours.\n\nThe statistical analysis of adjusted mean SPID and adjusted mean peak PID (n = 196) showed that meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg reduced pain intensity significantly more than either codeine or placebo *(P < 0.005)* overall and for peak values. In addition, meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg and meclofenamate 100 mg alone were both statistically superior to placebo for both measures (Table 2).\n\n# *Pain Relief*\n\nAdjusted mean pain relief scores over 6 hours are shown in Fig 2. Meclofenamate plus codeine produced the greatest pain relief over time. The poorest pain relief over time was observed for codeine and placebo: their adjusted mean scores ranged between 0 and 1 (0 = no relief, 1 = a little relief) for codeine at 0.5 and 2 through 6 hours, and for placebo throughout the entire observation period.\n\nThe statistical analysis of adjusted mean TOT-PAR and adjusted mean pain relief demonstrated results analogous to those of adjusted mean SPID\n\n| Variable | Treatment (mg)       |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n|----------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n|          | M1OO+C60<br>,\" = 40) | M 50 + c30<br>(n = 40) | Ml00<br>(II = 41) | C6!l<br>(n = 39) | P<br>(n = 40) | Total<br>(n = 200) |\n| Sex      |                      |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n| Male     | 9                    | 5                      | 11                | 6                | 4             | 35                 |\n| Female   | 31                   | 35                     | 30                | 33               | 36            | 165                |\n| Race     |                      |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n| White    | 31                   | 27                     | 28                | 26               | 30            | 142                |\n| Black    | 8                    | 10                     | 12                | 12               | 9             | 51                 |\n| Other    | 1                    | 3                      | 1                 | 1                | 1             | 7                  |\n| Age      |                      |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n| Mean     | 21.6                 | 23.3                   | 22.8              | 22.9             | 22.7          | 22.7               |\n| Range    | 16-33                | 16-35                  | 16-37             | 16-29            | 16-32         | 16-37              |\n\nAbbreviations: M, meclofenamate; C, codeine; P, placebo.\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nFIGURE 1.

Patients who took meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg had a significantly greater adjusted mean number of observations (P < .005) with pain at least\n\n| Table 2.  | Adjusted Mean SPID and Peak PID |  |  |  |\n|-----------|---------------------------------|--|--|--|\n| (n = 1SS) |                                 |  |  |  |\n\n| Treatment Group                           | Number<br>of<br>Patients | Adjusted<br>Mean<br>SPID | Adjusted<br>Mean Peak<br>PID |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Meclofenamate<br>100 mpl<br>codeine 60 mg | 39                       | 4.48*+                   | 1.29*t                       |\n| Meclofenamate<br>50 mgl                   |                          |                          |                              |\n| codeine 30 mg                             | 40                       | 2.22*                    | 1.08*                        |\n| Meclofenamate<br>100 mg                   | 41                       | 2.11*                    | 1.04*                        |\n| Codeine 60 mg                             | 37                       | -0.14                    | 0.64                         |\n| Placebo                                   | 39                       | -2.89                    | 0.16                         |\n\n\\* Significant difference from codeine (P < ,005).\n\nt Signiticant difference from placebo (P < .OO5).\n\nhalf relieved than did patients who took codeine or placebo. In addition, pain was at least half relieved at significantly more observations with both meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg and meclofenamate alone than with placebo alone. The mean results were meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 3.46 observations; meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, 2.59; meclofenamate 100 mg, 2.51; codeine, 1.52; and placebo, 0.74.\n\n# *Overall Evaluation of Study Drugs*\n\nEach patient evaluated the effectiveness of the study drug (the potential range was 1, excellent, to 5, poor; n = 196).

In addition, both meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg and meclofenamate 100 mg had a significantly better rating than placebo. The mean results were as follows: meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 2.15; meclofenamate IO0 mg, 1.87; meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, 1.65; codeine, 1.15; and placebo, 0.51.\n\n#### *Time to Remedication*\n\nTime to remedication was the time between taking the study medication and taking the backup medication.

The meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, and meclofenamate 100 mg treatment groups had significantly longer adjusted mean times to remedication with a backup analgesic drug (P < .005) than the placebo treatment group (n = 196). The mean times, in hours, were as follows: meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 3.98; meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, 3.78; meclofenamate 100 mg, 3.43; codeine 60 mg, 2.89; and placebo, 1.80.\n\n# SAFETY\n\nA total of 11 adverse events (regardless of possible relation to study drug) were reported by 7 (3.5%) of 200 patients: meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 2 (5.0%) of 40 patients; meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, 4 (10%) of 40 pa-\n\n| Table 3. |                       |  | Adjusted Mean TOTPAR and Peak |\n|----------|-----------------------|--|-------------------------------|\n|          | Pain Relief (n = 195) |  |                               |\n\n| Treatment Group          | Number<br>of<br>Patients | Adjusted<br>Mean<br>TOTPAR | Adjusted<br>Mean Peak<br>Pain Relief |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Meclofenamate<br>100 mg/ |                          |                            |                                      |\n| codeine 60 mg            | 39                       | 12.21*t                    | 3.46*-F                              |\n| Meclofenamate<br>50 mgi  |                          |                            |                                      |\n| codeine 30 mg            | 40                       | 9.ot3*                     | 2.59*                                |\n| Meclofenamate<br>100 mg  | 41                       | 9.19*                      | 2.51*                                |\n| Codeine 60 mg            | 37                       | 4.96                       | 1.52                                 |\n| Placebo                  | 39                       | 2.63                       | 0.74                                 |\n\n\\* Significant difference from codeine (P < .005).\n\nt Significant difference from placebo (P < .005).\n\ntients; and codeine, 1 (2.6%) of 39 patients. None was considered serious. Patients in the meclofenamate 100 mg and placebo treatment groups did not report any adverse experiences. The most common adverse experience was somnolence, which occurred in 1 (2.5%) of the patients who received meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 2 (5.0%) who received meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, and 1 (2.6%) who received codeine 60 mg (Table 4).\n\n#### Discussion\n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) have proven to be effective in relieving postoperative pain.18 Like all members of this class of drugs, meclofenamate acts peripherally by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis and by binding competitively at the prostaglandin receptor sites. Meclofenamate has also been found to be an in vitro inhibitor of human leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase activity. This study was undertaken to determine the feasibility and desirability of combining meclofenamate with codeine to obtain greater pain relief or control than can be achieved with either drug alone in conditions producing moderate or severe pain. Such a fixedcombination product may be clinically advantageous for patients requiring both central and peripheral analgesia.\n\nThe results of this study show that meclofenamate with codeine provides greater pain relief. Patients who received the combination of meclofenamate 100 mg and codeine 60 mg had a better effl-\n\n| Body System,<br>Adverse Event | M 100 + c60<br>(n = 40) | M 50 + C 30<br>(n = 40) | C<br>(n = 39) | Total<br>(n = 200) |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| Body as a whole               |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Headache                      | 0 (0.0)                 | 2 (5.0)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 2 (1.0)            |\n| Digestive system              |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Nausea/vomiting               | 1 (2.5)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 2 (1.0)            |\n| Nervous system                |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Somnolence                    | 1 (2.5)                 | 2 (5.0)                 | 1 (2.6)       | 4 (2.0)            |\n| Psychobiological<br>function  |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Doped-up sensation            | 0 (0.0)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 1 (0.5)            |\n| Hallucinations                | 0 (0.0)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 1 (0.5)            |\n| Thinking abnormal             | 0 (0.0)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 1 (0.5)            |\n\nTable 4.

Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg was also significantly more effective (Z' < .005) than codeine 60 mg for all variables except for the adjusted mean number of observations at which pain was half relieved. The combination of meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg did have a better clinical efficacy response than meclofenamate alone, but not at the stringent *P < .005* significance level.\n\nBoth meclofenamate combinations used in this study were well tolerated. On acute dosage, only 2 of 40 patients with the higher dosage and 4 of 40 with the lower dosage had adverse experiences. The most common symptom was somnolence. Gastrointestinal distress attributed to the combination was reported in only 2 patients.\n\nIn addition to its excellent effect on postsurgical pain, meclofenamate plus codeine has a further advantage not investigated in this study. Because this combination is anti-inflammatory as well as analgesic, it provides an added beneficial effect often required in the postsurgical period. This makes the combination preferable to acetaminophen and codeine, which does not have this property.\n\n# References\n\n- 1.

          "[[ ## reasoning ## ]]\nThe user wants to extract all outcomes for the \"Meclofenamate 100mg + Codeine 60mg\" intervention group.\n\n1.  **Identify Intervention Group and Population Size**: The group is explicitly named \"Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg\" and abbreviated as \"M100+C60\".\n    *   **Safety Population**: Table 1 shows that 40 patients were initially enrolled in this group (`n=40`). The \"SAFETY\" section confirms this, stating adverse events were reported for 2 of 40 patients. This `n=40` will be used for `n_analyzed` for all adverse events.\n    *   **Efficacy Population**: The \"Exclusions From Efficacy Analyses\" section states that \"One patient who received meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg ... was excluded from all efficacy analyses.\" Therefore, the efficacy population is 40 - 1 = 39 patients. This `n=39` is confirmed in Table 2 and Table 3.\n\n2.  **Scan for Outcomes**: I scanned the entire document including text, figures, and tables for outcomes related to this group.\n\n3.  **Efficacy Outcomes Extraction**:\n    *   The paper reports several efficacy outcomes: Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID), Peak Pain Intensity Difference (Peak PID), Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR), Peak Pain Relief, number of observations with pain half relieved, overall evaluation, and time to remedication.\n    *   However, all of these efficacy outcomes are reported as continuous data (adjusted means) and not as dichotomous data (number of events out of total analyzed). For example, the mean time to remedication is given as 3.98 hours, but the number of patients who actually required remedication is not provided.\n    *   The required JSON output format has mandatory fields `n_events_number` and `n_events_percentage`, which are designed for dichotomous data. As the paper does not provide the number of patients achieving certain efficacy endpoints (e.g., number needing rescue analgesia), these outcomes cannot be extracted into the specified format. Therefore, no efficacy outcomes are included in the final JSON.\n\n4.  **Adverse Effects Extraction**:\n    *   The \"SAFETY\" section and Table 4 provide dichotomous data on adverse events over the 6-hour study period for the safety population (`n_analyzed` = 40).\n    *   The extraction mandate requires capturing *every* outcome, including zero-event outcomes. Table 4 lists several specific adverse events. I will create a separate JSON object for each one.\n    *   **Nausea/vomiting**: 1 event out of 40 patients (1/40 = 2.5%).\n    *   **Somnolence**: 1 event out of 40 patients (1/40 = 2.5%).\n    *   **Headache**: 0 events out of 40 patients (0/40 = 0.0%).\n    *   **Doped-up sensation**: 0 events out of 40 patients (0/40 = 0.0%).\n    *   **Hallucinations**: 0 events out of 40 patients (0/40 = 0.0%).\n    *   **Thinking abnormal**: 0 events out of 40 patients (0/40 = 0.0%).\n    *   All these outcomes fall under `outcome_type` 5. The `follow_up_time` is \"6 hours\" as stated in the methods section.\n\n5.  **Final JSON Construction**: Based on the extracted adverse event data, I constructed a JSON list containing six objects, one for each specific adverse event listed in Table 4 for the \"M100+C60\" group. All mandatory and conditional fields are filled according to the guidelines.\n\n[[ ## all_outcomes_json ## ]]\n[\n  {\n    \"outcome_type\": 5,\n    \"follow_up_time\": \"6 hours\",\n    \"n_analyzed\": 40,\n    \"n_events_number\": 1,\n    \"n_events_percentage\": 2.5,\n    \"adverse_effect_specify\": \"Nausea/vomiting\",\n    \"other_outcome_specify\": \"NA\",\n    \"adverse_effects_all_study\": \"NA\",\n    \"extraction_notes\": \"From Table 4, Safety population.

GIGLIO, DDS, MED,\\* AND DANIEL M. LASKIN, DDS, MSt\n\nA single-dose, randomized, double-blind, parallel-treatment study was performed in 200 outpatients with acute pain caused by the surgical removal of impacted third molars. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, meclofenamate 100 mg, codeine 60 mg, and placebo treatment groups were compared for sum of pain intensity differences, peak pain intensity difference, sum of pain relief scores, peak pain relief, number of observations at which pain was half relieved, overall evaluation of effectiveness, and time to remedication with a backup analgesic. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg was significantly more effective (P < .005) than codeine 60 mg for all variables except number of observations at which pain was half relieved. Both meclofenamate-codeine combinations and meclofenamate 100 mg alone were significantly more effective (P < .005) than placebo for all variables. Eleven adverse experiences were reported in 7 patients (3.5%); the most common was somnolence in 1 patient receiving meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, in 2 treated with meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, and in 1 treated with codeine 60 mg.\n\nMeclofenamate sodium (Meclomen, Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research Division, Warner-Lambert Co, Morris Plains, NJ), a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and competes with formed prostaglandins for receptor sites. L-4 It has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Published literature provides evidence that meclofenamate is safe and effective in the treatment of patients with acute dental pain following third molar extraction,5q6 rheumatoid arthritis,'\\*\\* osteoarthritis,9-\" ankylosing spondylitis,'2\\*13 and gout,14 and for the pain of episiotomy.15\\*'6\n\nThe objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy and safety of a fixed combination of meclofenamate, which acts peripherally, and codeine, which acts centrally, and to evaluate whether such a combination is more beneficial than either ingredient acting alone in patients with pain due to oral surgery. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg was compared with its components, with placebo, and with meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg.17\n\nReceived from the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond.\n\n<sup>\\*</sup> Associate Professor.\n\nt Professor and Chairman.\n\nPresented at the American Association for Dental Research, San Francisco, CA, March 1989.\n\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Dr Laskin: Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical College of Virginia, PO Box 566, MCV Station, Richmond, VA 23298- 0566.\n\n**<sup>0 1990</sup> American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons** \n\n**<sup>0278-2391/90/4808-0003\\$3.00/</sup>O** \n\n# Materials and Methods\n\n# **STUDY DESIGN**\n\nThis was a single-dose, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, parallel-treatment study in outpatients with moderate or severe pain **caused**  by the surgical removal of impacted third molars. Before the study, the protocol was approved by the Committee on the Conduct of Human Research of Virginia Commonwealth University. Each patient was supplied with a diary to record information on efficacy and safety over 6 hours following study drug administration and instructed to return it at the next scheduled visit to the study site.\n\n#### **PATIENT SELECTION**\n\nSelected for the study were outpatients at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the Medical College of Virginia, 16 to 37 years old, who were scheduled to undergo the surgical removal of impacted third molars, at least one of which was a partial or full bony impaction. Before participation, each patient signed a written informed consent statement, medical histories were taken, and physical examinations were performed. Patients were excluded from the study if they had medical conditions that contraindicated the use of any of the study medications or if they had known hypersensitivities, allergies, or idiosyncratic reactions to any of the study medications. Female patients were excluded if they were pregnant or nursing. In addition, no patient could be taking any medication that would confound the effects of the study drug or have taken any analgesics or anti-inflammatory agents within a 4-hour period before surgery.\n\n#### **ANESTHETIC REGIMEN**\n\nPatients were treated under local block (mandibular teeth) or infiltration (maxillary teeth) anesthesia using 2% lidocaine with epinephrine l:lOO,OOO supplemented with intravenous diazepam and N20/02 administered by nasal mask. If necessary, methohexital was given intravenously.\n\n# **STUDY MEDICATION**\n\nAll study medications were identical in appearance. Each patient received a single dose consisting of one of the following: 1) one capsule of meclofenamate 100 mg and one of codeine 60 mg, 2) one capsule of meclofenamate 50 mg and one of codeine 30 mg, 3) one capsule of meclofenamate 100 mg and one of placebo, 4) one capsule of codeine 60 mg and\n\none of placebo, or 5) two capsules of placebo. Backup medication of acetaminophen 300 mg plus codeine 30 mg, one or two every 6 hours, was provided to patients for use if additional relief from postsurgical pain was needed.\n\n# **STUDYEVALUATION**\n\nThe efficacy evaluation was based on patient diary records. At 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after taking the study drug, patients rated pain relief and pain intensity. Pain intensity was scored as none = 0, slight = 1, moderate = 2, or severe = 3. Pain relief was scored as none = 0, a little = 1, some = 2, a lot = 3, or complete = 4. Patients also indicated whether the pain was at least half relieved at each of the observation points (yes or no) and gave the time of administration of the backup medication. At the end of the 6-hour study period, each patient evaluated the study drug as excellent = I, very good = 2, good = 3, fair = 4, or poor = 5.\n\nA pain intensity difference (PID) score was calculated for each of the seven posttreatment observation times for each patient by subtracting the posttreatment pain intensity score from the one at baseline (a greater positive score indicates greater improvement). A sum of pain intensity differences (SPID) was then determined by adding the seven PID ratings; a sum of pain relief scores (TOTPAR) was determined in the analogous manner by adding a patient's seven pain relief scores.\n\nThe variables of interest for efficacy were adjusted mean values for SPID and peak PID; TOT-PAR, peak pain relief, number of observations at which pain was half relieved; overall evaluation of study medication effectiveness; and time to remedication with a backup analgesic. The safety evaluation was based on the incidence and severity of adverse experiences that occurred during the 6-hour study period and were recorded in the patient diaries.\n\n# **STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY**\n\nAs treatment groups were significantly different (x2 = 10.46, *P =* .033) with respect to baseline pain intensity, the statistical methodology for the effrcacy data used an ANCOVA with baseline pain intensity as covariate to adjust for this difference. (Although all patients had moderate or severe baseline pain intensity, there were significantly more patients with severe pain in the groups receiving meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg or meclofenamate 100 mg.) Pairwise f-test comparisons were performed on adjusted means. These adjusted mean scores are reported as least square\n\nmeans. Because there were 10 possible pairwise comparisons, a Bonferroni adjusted significance level of 0.005 (0.05 + 10) was used for every pairwise comparison to preserve the overall experiment-wide significance level of 0.05. Computation was performed using the SAS procedure General Linear Model. Summary tables were produced for adverse experience data.\n\n# Results\n\n# PATIENT POPULATION\n\nTwo hundred patients, 35 men and 165 women, were enrolled and received study medication. There were 142 whites (71%), 51 blacks (25.5%), and 7 (3.5%) patients of other races, ranging in age from 16 to 37 years (mean, 22.7). Table 1 shows these data by treatment group, as well as the number of patients in each treatment group. There were no significant differences between study groups in mean time from end of surgery to treatment with study medication.\n\n#### EFFICACY ANALYSES\n\n# *Exclusions From Efficacy Analyses*\n\nThere were no withdrawals among the 200 patients. However, 4 patients were excluded from all efficacy analyses. One patient who received meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg and 2 patients who received codeine were excluded because they took backup medication less than 1 hour after study medication. Another placebo-treated patient was excluded because she took the study medication intended for another patient 30 minutes after she took her own. One additional patient who received meclofenamate 50 mg and codeine 30 mg was excluded from the analyses for TOTPAR and\n\n# Table 1. Patient Characteristics\n\npeak pain value because she had two values for pain relief missing in the first 4 hours following study medication.\n\n# *Pain Intensity*\n\nAdjusted PID scores over 6 hours for each of the five treatment groups are shown in Fig 1. The group that took meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg had the largest mean values (greatest improvement) at each time point, followed by groups receiving meclofenamate 100 mg and meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg. Both codeine and placebo groups showed negative adjusted mean values during most of the study, indicating an increase in pain intensity from baseline: codeine from 2 to 6 hours and placebo from 0.5 to 6 hours.\n\nThe statistical analysis of adjusted mean SPID and adjusted mean peak PID (n = 196) showed that meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg reduced pain intensity significantly more than either codeine or placebo *(P < 0.005)* overall and for peak values. In addition, meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg and meclofenamate 100 mg alone were both statistically superior to placebo for both measures (Table 2).\n\n# *Pain Relief*\n\nAdjusted mean pain relief scores over 6 hours are shown in Fig 2. Meclofenamate plus codeine produced the greatest pain relief over time. The poorest pain relief over time was observed for codeine and placebo: their adjusted mean scores ranged between 0 and 1 (0 = no relief, 1 = a little relief) for codeine at 0.5 and 2 through 6 hours, and for placebo throughout the entire observation period.\n\nThe statistical analysis of adjusted mean TOT-PAR and adjusted mean pain relief demonstrated results analogous to those of adjusted mean SPID\n\n| Variable | Treatment (mg)       |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n|----------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n|          | M1OO+C60<br>,\" = 40) | M 50 + c30<br>(n = 40) | Ml00<br>(II = 41) | C6!l<br>(n = 39) | P<br>(n = 40) | Total<br>(n = 200) |\n| Sex      |                      |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n| Male     | 9                    | 5                      | 11                | 6                | 4             | 35                 |\n| Female   | 31                   | 35                     | 30                | 33               | 36            | 165                |\n| Race     |                      |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n| White    | 31                   | 27                     | 28                | 26               | 30            | 142                |\n| Black    | 8                    | 10                     | 12                | 12               | 9             | 51                 |\n| Other    | 1                    | 3                      | 1                 | 1                | 1             | 7                  |\n| Age      |                      |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n| Mean     | 21.6                 | 23.3                   | 22.8              | 22.9             | 22.7          | 22.7               |\n| Range    | 16-33                | 16-35                  | 16-37             | 16-29            | 16-32         | 16-37              |\n\nAbbreviations: M, meclofenamate; C, codeine; P, placebo.\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nFIGURE 1.

In addition, pain was at least half relieved at significantly more observations with both meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg and meclofenamate alone than with placebo alone. The mean results were meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 3.46 observations; meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, 2.59; meclofenamate 100 mg, 2.51; codeine, 1.52; and placebo, 0.74.\n\n# *Overall Evaluation of Study Drugs*\n\nEach patient evaluated the effectiveness of the study drug (the potential range was 1, excellent, to 5, poor; n = 196). Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg had a significantly larger mean score (P < .005) than codeine or placebo. In addition, both meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg and meclofenamate 100 mg had a significantly better rating than placebo. The mean results were as follows: meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 2.15; meclofenamate IO0 mg, 1.87; meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, 1.65; codeine, 1.15; and placebo, 0.51.\n\n#### *Time to Remedication*\n\nTime to remedication was the time between taking the study medication and taking the backup medication. For patients who did not take a backup medication during the 6-hour posttreatment period,\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nit was set at 6 hours. The meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, and meclofenamate 100 mg treatment groups had significantly longer adjusted mean times to remedication with a backup analgesic drug (P < .005) than the placebo treatment group (n = 196). The mean times, in hours, were as follows: meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 3.98; meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, 3.78; meclofenamate 100 mg, 3.43; codeine 60 mg, 2.89; and placebo, 1.80.\n\n# SAFETY\n\nA total of 11 adverse events (regardless of possible relation to study drug) were reported by 7 (3.5%) of 200 patients: meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 2 (5.0%) of 40 patients; meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, 4 (10%) of 40 pa-\n\n| Table 3. |                       |  | Adjusted Mean TOTPAR and Peak |\n|----------|-----------------------|--|-------------------------------|\n|          | Pain Relief (n = 195) |  |                               |\n\n| Treatment Group          | Number<br>of<br>Patients | Adjusted<br>Mean<br>TOTPAR | Adjusted<br>Mean Peak<br>Pain Relief |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Meclofenamate<br>100 mg/ |                          |                            |                                      |\n| codeine 60 mg            | 39                       | 12.21*t                    | 3.46*-F                              |\n| Meclofenamate<br>50 mgi  |                          |                            |                                      |\n| codeine 30 mg            | 40                       | 9.ot3*                     | 2.59*                                |\n| Meclofenamate<br>100 mg  | 41                       | 9.19*                      | 2.51*                                |\n| Codeine 60 mg            | 37                       | 4.96                       | 1.52                                 |\n| Placebo                  | 39                       | 2.63                       | 0.74                                 |\n\n\\* Significant difference from codeine (P < .005).\n\nt Significant difference from placebo (P < .005).\n\ntients; and codeine, 1 (2.6%) of 39 patients.

The most common adverse experience was somnolence, which occurred in 1 (2.5%) of the patients who received meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 2 (5.0%) who received meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, and 1 (2.6%) who received codeine 60 mg (Table 4).\n\n#### Discussion\n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) have proven to be effective in relieving postoperative pain.18 Like all members of this class of drugs, meclofenamate acts peripherally by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis and by binding competitively at the prostaglandin receptor sites. Meclofenamate has also been found to be an in vitro inhibitor of human leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase activity. This study was undertaken to determine the feasibility and desirability of combining meclofenamate with codeine to obtain greater pain relief or control than can be achieved with either drug alone in conditions producing moderate or severe pain. Such a fixedcombination product may be clinically advantageous for patients requiring both central and peripheral analgesia.\n\nThe results of this study show that meclofenamate with codeine provides greater pain relief. Patients who received the combination of meclofenamate 100 mg and codeine 60 mg had a better effl-\n\n| Body System,<br>Adverse Event | M 100 + c60<br>(n = 40) | M 50 + C 30<br>(n = 40) | C<br>(n = 39) | Total<br>(n = 200) |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| Body as a whole               |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Headache                      | 0 (0.0)                 | 2 (5.0)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 2 (1.0)            |\n| Digestive system              |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Nausea/vomiting               | 1 (2.5)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 2 (1.0)            |\n| Nervous system                |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Somnolence                    | 1 (2.5)                 | 2 (5.0)                 | 1 (2.6)       | 4 (2.0)            |\n| Psychobiological<br>function  |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Doped-up sensation            | 0 (0.0)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 1 (0.5)            |\n| Hallucinations                | 0 (0.0)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 1 (0.5)            |\n| Thinking abnormal             | 0 (0.0)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 1 (0.5)            |\n\nTable 4.

Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg was also significantly more effective (Z' < .005) than codeine 60 mg for all variables except for the adjusted mean number of observations at which pain was half relieved. The combination of meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg did have a better clinical efficacy response than meclofenamate alone, but not at the stringent *P < .005* significance level.\n\nBoth meclofenamate combinations used in this study were well tolerated. On acute dosage, only 2 of 40 patients with the higher dosage and 4 of 40 with the lower dosage had adverse experiences. The most common symptom was somnolence. Gastrointestinal distress attributed to the combination was reported in only 2 patients.\n\nIn addition to its excellent effect on postsurgical pain, meclofenamate plus codeine has a further advantage not investigated in this study. Because this combination is anti-inflammatory as well as analgesic, it provides an added beneficial effect often required in the postsurgical period. This makes the combination preferable to acetaminophen and codeine, which does not have this property.\n\n# References\n\n- 1.

GIGLIO, DDS, MED,\\* AND DANIEL M. LASKIN, DDS, MSt\n\nA single-dose, randomized, double-blind, parallel-treatment study was performed in 200 outpatients with acute pain caused by the surgical removal of impacted third molars. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, meclofenamate 100 mg, codeine 60 mg, and placebo treatment groups were compared for sum of pain intensity differences, peak pain intensity difference, sum of pain relief scores, peak pain relief, number of observations at which pain was half relieved, overall evaluation of effectiveness, and time to remedication with a backup analgesic. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg was significantly more effective (P < .005) than codeine 60 mg for all variables except number of observations at which pain was half relieved. Both meclofenamate-codeine combinations and meclofenamate 100 mg alone were significantly more effective (P < .005) than placebo for all variables. Eleven adverse experiences were reported in 7 patients (3.5%); the most common was somnolence in 1 patient receiving meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, in 2 treated with meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, and in 1 treated with codeine 60 mg.\n\nMeclofenamate sodium (Meclomen, Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research Division, Warner-Lambert Co, Morris Plains, NJ), a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and competes with formed prostaglandins for receptor sites. L-4 It has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Published literature provides evidence that meclofenamate is safe and effective in the treatment of patients with acute dental pain following third molar extraction,5q6 rheumatoid arthritis,'\\*\\* osteoarthritis,9-\" ankylosing spondylitis,'2\\*13 and gout,14 and for the pain of episiotomy.15\\*'6\n\nThe objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy and safety of a fixed combination of meclofenamate, which acts peripherally, and codeine, which acts centrally, and to evaluate whether such a combination is more beneficial than either ingredient acting alone in patients with pain due to oral surgery. Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg was compared with its components, with placebo, and with meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg.17\n\nReceived from the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond.\n\n<sup>\\*</sup> Associate Professor.\n\nt Professor and Chairman.\n\nPresented at the American Association for Dental Research, San Francisco, CA, March 1989.\n\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Dr Laskin: Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical College of Virginia, PO Box 566, MCV Station, Richmond, VA 23298- 0566.\n\n**<sup>0 1990</sup> American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons** \n\n**<sup>0278-2391/90/4808-0003\\$3.00/</sup>O** \n\n# Materials and Methods\n\n# **STUDY DESIGN**\n\nThis was a single-dose, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, parallel-treatment study in outpatients with moderate or severe pain **caused**  by the surgical removal of impacted third molars. Before the study, the protocol was approved by the Committee on the Conduct of Human Research of Virginia Commonwealth University. Each patient was supplied with a diary to record information on efficacy and safety over 6 hours following study drug administration and instructed to return it at the next scheduled visit to the study site.\n\n#### **PATIENT SELECTION**\n\nSelected for the study were outpatients at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the Medical College of Virginia, 16 to 37 years old, who were scheduled to undergo the surgical removal of impacted third molars, at least one of which was a partial or full bony impaction. Before participation, each patient signed a written informed consent statement, medical histories were taken, and physical examinations were performed. Patients were excluded from the study if they had medical conditions that contraindicated the use of any of the study medications or if they had known hypersensitivities, allergies, or idiosyncratic reactions to any of the study medications. Female patients were excluded if they were pregnant or nursing. In addition, no patient could be taking any medication that would confound the effects of the study drug or have taken any analgesics or anti-inflammatory agents within a 4-hour period before surgery.\n\n#### **ANESTHETIC REGIMEN**\n\nPatients were treated under local block (mandibular teeth) or infiltration (maxillary teeth) anesthesia using 2% lidocaine with epinephrine l:lOO,OOO supplemented with intravenous diazepam and N20/02 administered by nasal mask. If necessary, methohexital was given intravenously.\n\n# **STUDY MEDICATION**\n\nAll study medications were identical in appearance. Each patient received a single dose consisting of one of the following: 1) one capsule of meclofenamate 100 mg and one of codeine 60 mg, 2) one capsule of meclofenamate 50 mg and one of codeine 30 mg, 3) one capsule of meclofenamate 100 mg and one of placebo, 4) one capsule of codeine 60 mg and\n\none of placebo, or 5) two capsules of placebo. Backup medication of acetaminophen 300 mg plus codeine 30 mg, one or two every 6 hours, was provided to patients for use if additional relief from postsurgical pain was needed.\n\n# **STUDYEVALUATION**\n\nThe efficacy evaluation was based on patient diary records. At 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after taking the study drug, patients rated pain relief and pain intensity. Pain intensity was scored as none = 0, slight = 1, moderate = 2, or severe = 3. Pain relief was scored as none = 0, a little = 1, some = 2, a lot = 3, or complete = 4. Patients also indicated whether the pain was at least half relieved at each of the observation points (yes or no) and gave the time of administration of the backup medication. At the end of the 6-hour study period, each patient evaluated the study drug as excellent = I, very good = 2, good = 3, fair = 4, or poor = 5.\n\nA pain intensity difference (PID) score was calculated for each of the seven posttreatment observation times for each patient by subtracting the posttreatment pain intensity score from the one at baseline (a greater positive score indicates greater improvement). A sum of pain intensity differences (SPID) was then determined by adding the seven PID ratings; a sum of pain relief scores (TOTPAR) was determined in the analogous manner by adding a patient's seven pain relief scores.\n\nThe variables of interest for efficacy were adjusted mean values for SPID and peak PID; TOT-PAR, peak pain relief, number of observations at which pain was half relieved; overall evaluation of study medication effectiveness; and time to remedication with a backup analgesic. The safety evaluation was based on the incidence and severity of adverse experiences that occurred during the 6-hour study period and were recorded in the patient diaries.\n\n# **STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY**\n\nAs treatment groups were significantly different (x2 = 10.46, *P =* .033) with respect to baseline pain intensity, the statistical methodology for the effrcacy data used an ANCOVA with baseline pain intensity as covariate to adjust for this difference. (Although all patients had moderate or severe baseline pain intensity, there were significantly more patients with severe pain in the groups receiving meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg or meclofenamate 100 mg.) Pairwise f-test comparisons were performed on adjusted means. These adjusted mean scores are reported as least square\n\nmeans. Because there were 10 possible pairwise comparisons, a Bonferroni adjusted significance level of 0.005 (0.05 + 10) was used for every pairwise comparison to preserve the overall experiment-wide significance level of 0.05. Computation was performed using the SAS procedure General Linear Model. Summary tables were produced for adverse experience data.\n\n# Results\n\n# PATIENT POPULATION\n\nTwo hundred patients, 35 men and 165 women, were enrolled and received study medication. There were 142 whites (71%), 51 blacks (25.5%), and 7 (3.5%) patients of other races, ranging in age from 16 to 37 years (mean, 22.7). Table 1 shows these data by treatment group, as well as the number of patients in each treatment group. There were no significant differences between study groups in mean time from end of surgery to treatment with study medication.\n\n#### EFFICACY ANALYSES\n\n# *Exclusions From Efficacy Analyses*\n\nThere were no withdrawals among the 200 patients. However, 4 patients were excluded from all efficacy analyses. One patient who received meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg and 2 patients who received codeine were excluded because they took backup medication less than 1 hour after study medication. Another placebo-treated patient was excluded because she took the study medication intended for another patient 30 minutes after she took her own. One additional patient who received meclofenamate 50 mg and codeine 30 mg was excluded from the analyses for TOTPAR and\n\n# Table 1. Patient Characteristics\n\npeak pain value because she had two values for pain relief missing in the first 4 hours following study medication.\n\n# *Pain Intensity*\n\nAdjusted PID scores over 6 hours for each of the five treatment groups are shown in Fig 1. The group that took meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg had the largest mean values (greatest improvement) at each time point, followed by groups receiving meclofenamate 100 mg and meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg. Both codeine and placebo groups showed negative adjusted mean values during most of the study, indicating an increase in pain intensity from baseline: codeine from 2 to 6 hours and placebo from 0.5 to 6 hours.\n\nThe statistical analysis of adjusted mean SPID and adjusted mean peak PID (n = 196) showed that meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg reduced pain intensity significantly more than either codeine or placebo *(P < 0.005)* overall and for peak values. In addition, meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg and meclofenamate 100 mg alone were both statistically superior to placebo for both measures (Table 2).\n\n# *Pain Relief*\n\nAdjusted mean pain relief scores over 6 hours are shown in Fig 2. Meclofenamate plus codeine produced the greatest pain relief over time. The poorest pain relief over time was observed for codeine and placebo: their adjusted mean scores ranged between 0 and 1 (0 = no relief, 1 = a little relief) for codeine at 0.5 and 2 through 6 hours, and for placebo throughout the entire observation period.\n\nThe statistical analysis of adjusted mean TOT-PAR and adjusted mean pain relief demonstrated results analogous to those of adjusted mean SPID\n\n| Variable | Treatment (mg)       |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n|----------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n|          | M1OO+C60<br>,\" = 40) | M 50 + c30<br>(n = 40) | Ml00<br>(II = 41) | C6!l<br>(n = 39) | P<br>(n = 40) | Total<br>(n = 200) |\n| Sex      |                      |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n| Male     | 9                    | 5                      | 11                | 6                | 4             | 35                 |\n| Female   | 31                   | 35                     | 30                | 33               | 36            | 165                |\n| Race     |                      |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n| White    | 31                   | 27                     | 28                | 26               | 30            | 142                |\n| Black    | 8                    | 10                     | 12                | 12               | 9             | 51                 |\n| Other    | 1                    | 3                      | 1                 | 1                | 1             | 7                  |\n| Age      |                      |                        |                   |                  |               |                    |\n| Mean     | 21.6                 | 23.3                   | 22.8              | 22.9             | 22.7          | 22.7               |\n| Range    | 16-33                | 16-35                  | 16-37             | 16-29            | 16-32         | 16-37              |\n\nAbbreviations: M, meclofenamate; C, codeine; P, placebo.\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nFIGURE 1.

In addition, both meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg and meclofenamate 100 mg had a significantly better rating than placebo. The mean results were as follows: meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 2.15; meclofenamate IO0 mg, 1.87; meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, 1.65; codeine, 1.15; and placebo, 0.51.\n\n#### *Time to Remedication*\n\nTime to remedication was the time between taking the study medication and taking the backup medication.

The most common adverse experience was somnolence, which occurred in 1 (2.5%) of the patients who received meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg, 2 (5.0%) who received meclofenamate 50 mg plus codeine 30 mg, and 1 (2.6%) who received codeine 60 mg (Table 4).\n\n#### Discussion\n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) have proven to be effective in relieving postoperative pain.18 Like all members of this class of drugs, meclofenamate acts peripherally by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis and by binding competitively at the prostaglandin receptor sites. Meclofenamate has also been found to be an in vitro inhibitor of human leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase activity. This study was undertaken to determine the feasibility and desirability of combining meclofenamate with codeine to obtain greater pain relief or control than can be achieved with either drug alone in conditions producing moderate or severe pain. Such a fixedcombination product may be clinically advantageous for patients requiring both central and peripheral analgesia.\n\nThe results of this study show that meclofenamate with codeine provides greater pain relief. Patients who received the combination of meclofenamate 100 mg and codeine 60 mg had a better effl-\n\n| Body System,<br>Adverse Event | M 100 + c60<br>(n = 40) | M 50 + C 30<br>(n = 40) | C<br>(n = 39) | Total<br>(n = 200) |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| Body as a whole               |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Headache                      | 0 (0.0)                 | 2 (5.0)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 2 (1.0)            |\n| Digestive system              |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Nausea/vomiting               | 1 (2.5)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 2 (1.0)            |\n| Nervous system                |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Somnolence                    | 1 (2.5)                 | 2 (5.0)                 | 1 (2.6)       | 4 (2.0)            |\n| Psychobiological<br>function  |                         |                         |               |                    |\n| Doped-up sensation            | 0 (0.0)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 1 (0.5)            |\n| Hallucinations                | 0 (0.0)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 1 (0.5)            |\n| Thinking abnormal             | 0 (0.0)                 | 1 (2.5)                 | 0 (0.0)       | 1 (0.5)            |\n\nTable 4.

Meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg was also significantly more effective (Z' < .005) than codeine 60 mg for all variables except for the adjusted mean number of observations at which pain was half relieved. The combination of meclofenamate 100 mg plus codeine 60 mg did have a better clinical efficacy response than meclofenamate alone, but not at the stringent *P < .005* significance level.\n\nBoth meclofenamate combinations used in this study were well tolerated. On acute dosage, only 2 of 40 patients with the higher dosage and 4 of 40 with the lower dosage had adverse experiences. The most common symptom was somnolence. Gastrointestinal distress attributed to the combination was reported in only 2 patients.\n\nIn addition to its excellent effect on postsurgical pain, meclofenamate plus codeine has a further advantage not investigated in this study. Because this combination is anti-inflammatory as well as analgesic, it provides an added beneficial effect often required in the postsurgical period. This makes the combination preferable to acetaminophen and codeine, which does not have this property.\n\n# References\n\n- 1.
